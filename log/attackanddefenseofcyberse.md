# 🔐 CIAAN & Game Theory — Study Notes (2025-11-01)

## 🧩 CIAAN Overview
The concept of **CIAAN** was defined in 2008 in *“Introduction to Information Security”* by Lin Sapessante.  
It consists of **five key elements**: **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, and Non-repudiation**.

### 1. Confidentiality  
Protects communication and ensures that information is accessible only to authorized parties.

### 2. Integrity  
Maintains information in its original, intended form without unauthorized alteration.

### 3. Availability  
Ensures access to data and services when needed.  
A *failure of availability* means that an entity cannot use the required device or system.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization  
- **Authentication** defines methods to verify a user’s identity (ID).  
- **Authorization** defines what resources or areas the authenticated ID can access.

### 5. Non-repudiation  
A critical property that proves a specific event or action occurred in the past — preventing denial by involved parties.

## 🎮 Game Theory (GT)
**Game Theory** is a field of analysis that studies optimal strategies among participants in a game-like scenario.  
It is often abbreviated as **GT**.

GT seeks to find the **best response** each player can make under a given situation, sometimes using approximations to build stronger strategies.  
Isn’t that fascinating?

### Non-Cooperative Games  
In non-cooperative games, players compete to achieve their own optimal outcomes.  
Each participant seeks a **dominant response** that counters the opponent’s strategies.

> **Best Response:**  
> A player’s optimal strategy determined by the opponent’s actions.

## 📘 Personal Note
These are the topics I’ve been studying recently.  
I started reading a Korean book titled *“Cybersecurity: Offense and Defense”* which I purchased at a bookstore in Seoul while on leave from the military.  
I’ll continue to upload my study notes here regularly.
